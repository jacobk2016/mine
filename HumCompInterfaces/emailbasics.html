		<h3 align="center"><b>Welcome to The Email Lessons!</b></h3>
		<br>
		<p>In this tutorial, you will learn all of the basic concepts of email. If you don't know anything about email, that's okay! We're going to start from the beginning.
		Remember, if you are confused by any of the material, you can always come back to this lesson later or send us a feedback message with your question.</p>

		<h3 align="center">What is Email?</h3>
		<br>
		<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-5">

		<div class="col-lg-7">
		<p>Email is also known as E-mail. The letter 'E' stands for Electronic. So, Email is Electronic Mail. Email is letters and messages that people send each other electronically over the internet using computers or other devices.
		Each person signs up for an email service with a service provider. This service provider will give you a unique email address (kind of like a mailing address) that tells the internet where to take messages for you.
		Email is often used in the place of letters sent through the postal service (in our case, the United States Postal Service) for lots of reasons. It might seem strange to use email when you can just send someone a letter,
		but email has a lot of really cool features that a lot of people prefer over normal mail.</p>

		<br>
		<br>
		<h3 align="center">Why Should I Use Email?</h3>
		<br>
		<p>Like the last paragraph says, there are a lot of really great reasons to use Email in place of normal mail. Here are a few:</p>
			<ul class="list-unstyled">
				<li>
    				<ul>
      					<li><b>Email is Faster</b></li>
						<br>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because email is sent over the internet and computers use programs to send the information to each other, email is almost instant sometimes. 
						An email will typically take only a few seconds or minutes to be delivered. Of course, sometimes email messes up or takes longer.
						Occaisionally, emails may take fifteen minutes to 2 hours to deliver; However, unless they are being sent from an automated system, or the email service you use is very busy,
						that isn't very common. This means that it is easier to meet deadlines, and easier to get imporant information to the right person quickly. That said, you shouldn't panic if your email hasn't arrived yet. 
						If it takes longer than a few days, you can contact your email service provider about the problem.</p>
						<br>
      					<li><b>Email is Easier</b></li>
						<br>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a person has learned to type efficiently, writing an email is much faster and easier than writing a letter by hand. You can quickly type your message,
						 and it's easy to format it or change it as you go without have to rewrite the message (like you would with a piece of paper). This makes it easier and more efficient to send long messages,
						especially when you need them to look as professional or formal as possible.</p>
						<br>
      					<li><b>Email is used by most people</b></li>
						<br>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Email is one of the most important forms of business and personal communication today. Most people have an email address. It is common in business and personal
						discussions for a person to say they will "send an email about it later". Important reciepts, forms, resumes and other documents are now sent by email.
						If you don't have an email address, you get left behind in the communication and business part of the world.</p>
						<br>
      					<li><b>Email is easy to integrate with other online social activities</b></li>
						<br>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's very easy to connect to other online social activities through your email. In fact, you are required to have an email address in order to use
						most social networks and other online services (even shopping)! We'll talk more about this in the Social Network Lessons.</p>
						<br>
      					<li><b>Email is Easier to send large ammounts of information</b></li>
						<br>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you need to send someone large documents, you could spend a lot of time packaging them up for the USPS. 
						If you send them by email, it's as simple as adding an attachment to the email, which only takes a few clicks. When you use an attachment, sending the documents or images is free
						and takes less time. We'll talk more about this later in the lesson set.</p>
						<br>
      					<li><b>Email is less likely to be lost by human beings</b></li>
						<br>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you send mail through the USPS, it has a chance of getting lost by human error or the mail simply slipping out of it's container.
						With email, you don't have this problem. If an email isn't delivered correctly, you will recieve a notification to your own email address telling you that the
						email wasn't delivered, and why. This isn't very common, but it does happen. Of course there can be other errors on the part of the computers, but these are less typical
						than the USPS losing your mail.</p>
						<br>
      					<li><b>Email is Free</b></li>
						<br>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some paid email services, but for the most part, email is free! You can sign up for an email address with a service provider
						and almost always pay nothing for the account.</p>
						<br>
      					<li><b>Email is Environmentally Friendly</b></li>
						<br>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because email is digital and doesn't require the use of any paper, ink or other products, email is considered to be environmentally friendly.
						Email leaves no impact on the environment, and no waste for garbage yards. Email also doesn't create any clutter for your home like physical mail does!</p>
						<br>
    				</ul>
  				</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p>As you can see, there are a lot of really neat reasons to use email instead of physical mail through the postal service. When you're ready, it's time to get started on your own email adventure.</p>
