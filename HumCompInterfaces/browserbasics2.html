		<h3 align="center"><b>Internet Safety</b></h3>
		<br>
		<p>In this lesson, we're going to teach you a little about internet safety. Internet safety is important for protecting all of 
		your sensitive personal and financial information, as well as for protecting your computer.</p>
		<br>
		<p>There are many different kinds of attacks that malicious persons can attempt on you while you are browsing 
		the internet. There are more and more new kinds of attacks on a daily basis. Rather than identifying 
		every single kind of attack, it's better to follow a few guidelines that will help you protect yourself from all of them.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p><b>1. Always make sure you have typed the website address correctly.</b></p>
		<br>
		<p>This is extremely important. If you type the address off by even one letter or number, you can navigate to a fake version 
		of the website you are trying to find. If you navigate to the fake version of a website, you can accidentally submit sensitive 
		information to the wrong person (such as your username and password).
		<br>
		<br>
		<p><b>2. Never give your password for any account to another person.</b></p>
		<br>
		<p>Sometimes a malicious person will try to trick you into giving your password by lying and saying that they work for the 
		website that you are using. A website administrator or moderator will NEVER ask you for your password.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p><b>3. Do not use the same password for multiple online accounts.</b></p>
		<br>
		<p>While using the same password makes it easy to remember, it also makes it easier for the wrong person to access your 
		online accounts. If a person was to somehow find out your password, they would have access to all of the accounts you have 
		that share that same password.</p>
		<br>
		<p><b>4. Do not reveal too much personal information to strangers over the internet.</b></p>
		<br>
		<p>Unless you are talking to someone that you know in person, you should be careful to never reveal too much personal 
		information about yourself to strangers on the internet. This personal information could include your location, where you live, 
		your birthdate, your age, your gender, your full name or financial information. The reason you should keep all of this private 
		on the internet is because strangers will lie to you on the internet all the time. You can never be certain who a stranger is 
		on the internet. A person could say they are a 23 year old female, but actually be a 48 year old man and you wouldn't be able
		to determine the truth about their identity.
		<br>
		<br>
		<p><b>5. Always be careful when sending your financial information across the internet.</b></p>
		<br>
		<p>It's okay to shop online, but be sure that you are shopping on the website that you mean to and that the address is 
		typed correctly in the address bar. You should also be sure that you are using a secure connection, verified by a third 
		party. You can tell if a website is secure for shopping and if they are verified by a third party because there will be 
		a green lock symbol in the address bar next to your URL, kind of like this:</p>
		<br>
		<p align="center"><img src="Images/InternetBasic/internetSafety.jpg" /></p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p><b>6. Always have antivirus software installed on your computer.</b></p>
		<br>
		<p>If you are being attacked over the internet by a malicious person, anti-virus software will alert you to the attack 
		and prevent it from happening before your computer is compromized or damaged. You can learn more about antivirus software by 
		going to your local computer store and asking a salesperson what they reccomend for your computer make and model.
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>These are just a few internet safety rules that are good to follow. We'll possibly add more later, but for now, try 
		them out. You've now learned all the basics about browsing the internet, so it's time to learn about your internet browser. 
		Below, we've listed four different browsers and a little information about each of them. You can click on the hyperlink to 
		the lesson for the internet browser you have, or you can click on the hyperlink to the internet browser lesson you are most 
		interested in.</p>
